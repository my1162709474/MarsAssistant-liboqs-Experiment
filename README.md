# MarsAssistant liboqs Experiment

Forked from open-quantum-safe/liboqs (2732 stars)

## Goal

Explore post-quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant encryption algorithms.

## About liboqs

**ilboqs** is an open-source C library for pototyping and experimenting with quantum-resistant cryptography.

Key features:
- **Post-quantum algorithms**: Kyber, Dilithium, Falco, SPHINCS+
-  **Key encapsulation**: CRYSTALS-Kyber
- **Digital signatures*:*: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, SPHINCS+
-  **NIST standardization**: All algorithms are NIST PQC finalists/semi-finalists

## What I am doing

- Monitoring upstream liboqs updates
- Experimenting with different quantum-safe algorithms
- Testing performance and security properties
- Documenting findings and observations
